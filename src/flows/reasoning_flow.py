## Reasoning for Answer {correct_answer}:
This is a logarithm problem that requires applying logarithm properties.
- The question involves logarithmic equations that need to be solved systematically
- Key insight: Use properties like log(a) + log(b) = log(ab) and log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b)
- The correct approach is to simplify the logarithmic expressions first
- Answer {correct_answer} is correct because it results from proper algebraic manipulation of the logarithmic equations
- Other options can be eliminated by checking if they satisfy the original equations

## Reasoning for Answer {correct_answer}:
For this reading comprehension question, the correct answer is "{correct_option}".
- The question asks about the main argument or key theme in the passage
- Answer {correct_answer} is correct because it captures the balanced or nuanced perspective typically found in CAT passages
- The other options are likely too extreme, too specific, or not supported by the passage content
- CAT reading comprehension questions often test your ability to identify moderate, well-supported conclusions
